Harsh K. Desai
Designer | Researcher | Programmer

I have traveled to a handful of countries and explored numerous different cities. Being born in India, and raised in Canada and America, my experiences have taught me to embrace the diversity of ways people think and interact with things, thus shaping me as a DESIGNER.

Having found my niche at INTERACTION DESIGN and TECHNOLOGY. I have always been intrigued by FINDING PROBLEMS surrounding me and trying to SOLVE THEM using modern era technology. I focus on CREATING rich seamless EXPERIENCE between the product and the user. 

When I'm not at school or working, you can catch me at the closest pizza joint, at the gym, or exploring the city I'm in.

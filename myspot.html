Overview
Throughout fundamental readings about the design process and best practices, I worked towards developing a final, high-fidelity prototype after extensive background research, user testing, and decision iteration. From researching to sketching to prototyping, I learned about contemporary perspectives on interaction design through both reading and peer collaboration. Beginning with competitive analysis and ending with a presentation and clickable prototype, my work throughout the process of designing my solution, "MySpot," is shown below. Enjoy!

CHALLENGE

How to make finding parking a problem of the past?

After moving to Ann Arbor I realized it’s incredibly hard to find parking in any of the public lots or garages during normal work days and nearly impossible during weekends and days with major events. Usually, when searching for parking, people search for nearby public parking structures and/or manually go and check whether there are spots available or not. But this seems like a lot of hassle and usually leads to cars going through crowded areas on campus and creating traffic. To address these issues and inconveniences, I developed a mobile application that would allow users to view and reserve spots straight from their phones.


DESIGN PROCESS

Methodology
MySpot is a mobile app design of a semester-long solo project.  I conducted the end-to-end research and design process, from finding others who are experiencing this issue to validating design decisions by testing with target users. My design evolved along several rounds of iteration at different stages.

RESEARCH

Needfinding to frame the problem

Interviews
I conducted a round of Interviews with a total of 6 students, professors, and people who commute to downtown Ann Arbor to identify their pain points. It turned out that their frustrations stemmed from two aspects:

The race to see who gets to the parking spot first

Lack of parking spots available

Comparative Analysis

I analyzed multiple existing matching platforms, both physical and digital, and the University of Michigan Parking to explore the current solution space users can utilize to find parking.

Majority of all parking applications are based in large cities.

There are no parking services partnered up with universities.​

People still receive parking tickets using the parking applications.​

No parking app allows users to visualize which parking spots are available and it’s location.

Collect information on service alerts (transits and parking), bus routes and schedules, and parking permits.

IDEATION
Mapping needs to creative solutions

Brainstorm and storyboard
Based on the findings, I brainstormed for several solutions to tackle the users’ needs, and then expanded the sketches into scenarios that captured users’ pain points, emotion and interactions with each solution.

Personas
I created multiple pro-personas and an anti-persona based on the initial research and testings with sketches. The personas represent users’ goals and pain points that helped me to prioritize different user needs to guide the converging phase of my design process.

ITERATION AND REFINEMENT
Reasoning for design decisions

Paper Prototype
Using the information I gathered through my research, I developed the first prototype.

Tools Used

Post-it Notes

Focus
To understand the basic navigation and how different features would be implemented.

Observations/Feedbacks

"Set Time" button is too redundant since you're asking it later too.

QOC analysis
After conducting multiple user tests and gathering feedbacks from my paper prototype, I conducted a Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) analysis to determine the design aspect of the application. I came up with three different approaches and rationales on how to implement the key feature to help differentiate this app to its competitors.

Low/Mid Fidelity Prototype
Using the QOC analysis, I was able to determine how to visualize certain information on my application. Using this knowledge, I developed my second prototype.

Tools Used

Focus
To optimize the navigation and different human interactions throughout the application.

Observations/Feedbacks
	* Keep fonts consistent throughout the application.
	* Users didn’t know whether some fields were required or not
	* Users tried to click buttons in the background (behind the pop-up menus)
	* Darken the background so users know which is the main screen.
	* Add directions from the user's location to the parking structure
	* How to validate a user actually made a purchase
	* Make it easier change parking pass by simply clicking on the university name instead of going to settings.

Final & Interactive Prototype
For my final iteration, I implemented a few changes and added new features from the feedback I gathered from testing my second prototype.

IMPACT
This application would have a breakthrough for people who travel or commute on a daily basis. The goal of this application for the user to be free from the hassles of everyday travel by making it faster and easier to get where you need to go, so you can focus on the destination.

TAKEAWAY
I am my own users, but I am not like my users
My design problem stemmed from my personal experience and frustration. With users participating along my design process, I have gained more comprehensive understanding of different factors surrounding the problem to reduce my design bias. I also found the iterative approach extremely critical to my design, and prototyping rapidly played a role in the process. Getting feedback from real users helped me to validate the hypothesis and refine my design at all levels

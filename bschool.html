	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<br>
	<p>This project is the final outcome for the course SI 501 in School of Information, University of Michigan. To practice qualitative research method, contextual inquiry, I participated in a qualitative design consulting project for a real-world client: a travel company solely dedicated to connecting MBA students through travel and networking opportunities. Our primary objective was to streamline their communication process between their clients and suppliers.</p>

	<h1>Problem</h1>
	<p>Currently, *undisclosed name* has a lot of incoming traffic to their site, but they aren't able to convert the users into clients. Additionally, they lack a "Call to action" on the main page and have no methods to collect potential client's information. For the clients they do engage with, they have a poor system set up to collect and process the clients’ information to complete the sale. They also lack a system to manage their customer relationships with each client. The client would like for MQuad to investigate how this is managed by others within the industry, and propose a solution that can be implemented into their current system.</p>

	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>After the kick-off meeting, all team members conducted individual background research to have a better sense about our client and the relevant area. 
I approached from a technical perspective to investigate</p>
	<ul>
		<li>*What are some effective ways to convert website visitors into potential customers?</li>
		<li>* What is the most effective type of “Call for action” that can be implemented to their current system in order to increase website visits into clients and sales?</li>
		<li>* How to securely collect information from customers so ensure confidentiality?</li>
		<li>* What is a more efficient method of pipelining two-way communications with the customers and suppliers?</li>
		<li>* What are some problems that occurred with current clients and how to fix them?</li>
	</ul>
<p>With others' analysis of the target population, sector/industry, and comparative analysis, we had a comprehensive amount of knowledge about the problem.</p>

	<h1>Interviews</h1>
	<p>Overall, we conducted four semi-structured interviews with the organization’s co-founders, their intern, and a former client. One of the most important points in the interviews was to get the closest sense of their experiences in a working context. Therefore, when we prepared the interview protocol, we focused on setting the questions that ask a particular experience they had in detail: what they went through and what they experienced and why. All of our interviews were set at Ross School of Business. After each interview, the team had an interpretation session to revisit the interview, have a mutual understanding among the team, and find insights/questions.</p>

<section align="right">
	<h1>Affinity Wall</h1>
	<p>To organize our findings, we created a physical affinity wall which is a useful tool for data organization. For affinity wall, we printed all the meaningful/possibly meaningful interview findings and quotes and grouped 3-7 similar notes under a mother note and name it with a meaningful sentence that can overarch the rest of the notes. After we grouped all the notes, we had to iterate the grouping process twice more until there are only five bigger categories that can umbrella others: Business Plan, Communication, Systematic way for efficiency, Goals, and Difficulty and Roles. The process made us clear about the problem and observed findings from the interview so that we can have the ground for our solution brainstorming.</p>

	<h1>Key Findings</h1>
	<img src="images/group-profile-users.png" class="icon" alt="group-profile-users" />
	<p>Unclear roles and duties
“The roles are fluid and the boundaries are kind of merged between members”</p>
	<img src="images/two-gears.png" class="icon" alt="two-gears" />
	<p>Inefficient internal communication
“We usually do text messaging. But the fact that you sent a text message doesn't mean that you will be reply fast, so sometimes it was either I wait for the reply, or I just keep on going.”</p>
	<img src="images/speech-bubble.png" class="icon" alt="speech-bubble" />
	<p>Lack of a systematic way of managing customer requests and itineraries
“Our mail inbox is a nightmare.”</p>

	<h1>Recommendation</h1>
	<p>For our final recommendation to the client, my team and I recommended that *undisclosed name* should connect and collaborate with Desai Accelerator for mentorship. We came to this decision based on our key findings through research and interviews.
We believe that Desai Accelerator will not only be able to give guidance necessary for *undisclosed name* to rapidly grow and build their business, but also equip them with resources from both the University of Michigan and the city of Ann Arbor.</p>

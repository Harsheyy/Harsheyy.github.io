			<h1>My time at Clinc</h1>
			<br>
			<p>While being a full-time graduate student at University of Michigan's School of Information (Go Blue!), I got the opportunity to work at the fastest growing startup, Clinc, in Ann Arbor.</p>
			<p>During my internship at Clinc, I got to work on the Product Team as a UX Research intern! As an intern, I conducted user research, designed and prototyped a more approachable and valuable experience for all early and high-profile developers on the platform.</p>
			<p>As a researcher, I got to collaborate with: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Engineers to implement the changes and feedbacks I gathered from my studies.</li>
				<li>Project Managers to understand the pain points of our enterprise customers.</li>
				<li>The Education Team to help construct an onboarding process within the platform.</li>
				<li>People with various types of background for my studies.</li>

		<h2>The Challenge</h2>
		<p>As an already established platform, my task was to discover pain points throughout the platform, understand how customers and early developers interact with the platform, and how can we optimize navigation to make the end-to-end AI building process more intuitive.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="clinc_sec">
		<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
		<h2>Understanding the Platform</h2>
		<p>Before I could conduct any tests on the platform, I had to understand the design problem and define goals. 
		I spent the first few days exploring the platform and built a set of pain points I discovered. Based on the information I gathered, created a set of small Usability Tests focused to understand how users are interacting with the platform, and what improvements should be made. For this test, I gathered a small sample of participants with various different backgrounds to complete a set of tasks on the platform.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="clinc_sec">
		<h2>Tasks</h2>
		<p>The task given to the users was to be able to build a simple AI. The task was split into 5 sets to test each component of building an AI from scratch.
			<br>
			<i>An example of scenario included, “You just realized that you added the wrong slot to this competency, delete the current slot and add new slot (given by me).”</i>
			<br>
			After analyzing the results of this study, I came to conclude that the success rate of intuitively building an AI was <a class="bad">20%</a>.</p>

			<h2>New Navigation Proposal</h2>
			<p>I next conducted a Card Sorting test to understand user expectations and using these understanding to build a better structure of the platform. </p>
			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<p>To place the different tools found on the platform in tabs where the user thinks it belongs.
			The users were allowed to add/remove any tools or tabs while constructing their perspective of the platform.</p>
			<h2>Study</h2>
			<p>16 participants</p>

			<h1>Platform Navigation Feedback</h1>
			<p>I next conducted a Survey with the Engineers, Marketing/Sales team, and Product Managers to get feedback on the groupings and navigation of platform V2 (which was the result of my previous card-sorting test).</p>
			<p>For this survey, I was given a list of words generated by the Top-Executives and the reasoning on why they chose it. Using this information, I created a chart with listing the words and reasonings for each Nav. menu title and gathered feedback from others about their thoughts.</p>
			<p>Through the feedback gathered from people with mixed backgrounds, I came to conclude that the new grouping of the pages and new titles are very intuitive and well organized for users, both new and existing. Overall, everyone was highly positive about the new grouping and linear flow of the navigation - representing the end to end platform.</p>

			<h2>Post-Update Test</h2>
			<p>I conducted another set of Usability Tests to see if the updates made to the AI Versions page and sitemap were effective, to discover more pain points throughout the platform, and see how effective the newly added Knowledge Base is. </p>
			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<p>The tasks remained the same as the original test.
			A different set of participants were brought in.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>AI Versions page update was effective.
				New sitemap needs work.
			Knowledge Base update was not effective. </p>
			<h2>Pain Points Discovered</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Users don't understand the terminology for crowdsourcing and slot-pairing without hints/tips/documentation.</li>
				<li>Users have difficulty finding the crowdsource page.</li>
				<li>Slot-pairing process isn't intuitive.</li>
				<li>The end-to-end guide doesn’t actually guide the user, rather informations them of the terminology of the platform.</li>
